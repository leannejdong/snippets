/* [Description]
 *
 * When passing a complex data structure however, there are sometimes pointer variables hidden within, 
 * that point to a (potentially) shared data buffer - which might cause a data race even though 
 * the programmer believes that the copied data will effectively preempt this. 
 * The next example illustrates this case by adding a new member variable to the Vehicle class, 
 * which is a pointer to a string object, as well as the corresponding getter and setter functions.

 * 
 * [Output]
 * Vehicle #0 Default constructor called
 * Vehicle #1 initializing constructor called
 * Vehicle 2

 * The basic program structure is mostly identical to the previous example with 
 * the object v0 being copied by value when passed to the thread function. 
 * This time however, even though a copy has been made, the original object v0 is modified, 
 * when the thread function sets the new name. This happens because 
 * the member _name is a pointer to a string and after copying, even though 
 * the pointer variable has been duplicated, it still points to the same location as its value 
 * (i.e. the memory location) has not changed. Note that when the delay is removed in the thread function, 
 * the console output varies between "Vehicle 2" and "Vehicle 3", depending on the system scheduler. 
 * Such an error might go unnoticed for a long time. 
 * It could show itself well after a program has been shipped to the client - 
 * which is what makes this error type so treacherous.
