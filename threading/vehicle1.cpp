/* [Description]
 * 
 * Passing data to a thread in this way is a clean and safe method as there is no danger of a data race - 
 * at least when atomic data types such as integers, doubles, chars or booleans are passed.
 * 
 * Note that the class Vehicle has a default constructor and an initializing constructor. 
 * In the main function, when the instances v0 and v1 are created, each constructor is called respectively. 
 * Note that v0 is passed by value to a Lambda, which serves as the thread function for std::async. 
 * Within the Lambda, the id of the Vehicle object is changed from the default (which is 0) to a new value 2. 
 * Note that the thread execution is paused for 500 milliseconds to guarantee that the change is performed well
 * after the main thread has proceeded with its execution.
 * 
 * In the main thread, immediately after starting up the worker thread, the id of v0 is changed to 3. 
 * Then, after waiting for the completion of the thread, the vehicle id is printed to the console. 
 * In this program, the output will always be the following:
 * 
 * [Output]
 * Vehicle #0 Default constructor called
 * Vehicle #1 initializing constructor called
 * Vehicle #3
 *
